The Biofeedback System developed at the German Heart Center focuses on the creation of different games that may help to motivate children in the rehabilitation process after surgery, monitoring their vital parameters and adapting to specific conditions.

This paper describes the design and integration of a multi-player video racing ‘exergame’,  controlled via an ergometer and motion sensor, that utilizes the display of Biofeedback to increase or decrease the players physical activity depending on their current heart rate. A preliminary study with young healthy students showed that an aerobic exercise level can be reached, even during short sessions.
